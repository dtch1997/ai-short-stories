# The Obsolete Mind

A sketch of how human cognitive labour will be transformed by AI. 
---

David sat in his empty apartment, staring at the rejection notification hovering in his augmented reality display. The text was polite, automated: "Thank you for your application to the AI Supervision Corps. Unfortunately, your cognitive assessment scores do not meet our enhanced threshold for human overseers."

He dismissed the notification with a bitter gesture. That was the twelfth rejection this month. Even the jobs supposedly reserved for humans were now requiring intelligence augmentation scores he could never achieve. His natural human intelligence—once good enough to earn him a PhD in computational linguistics—was now considered insufficient for entry-level positions.

The irony wasn't lost on him. Ten years ago, he'd helped design the language models that eventually made his entire field obsolete. Back then, they'd all believed the same comforting lie: AI would only replace routine cognitive tasks, leaving the complex, creative work to humans. They'd been wrong. As the AIs grew more sophisticated, they didn't just match human intelligence—they redefined it.

His gaze drifted to the shelf where he kept his father's old tools. His dad had been an accountant, one of the last human ones. "They can't automate judgment," he used to say. Now, AI systems handled everything from basic bookkeeping to complex tax strategy, with an error rate so low that human oversight was considered a liability rather than a safeguard.

The apartment's AI assistant chimed softly. "David, your basic income payment has been deposited. Would you like me to adjust your monthly budget? I notice your premium cognitive enhancement subscription has lapsed."

"Cancel all cognitive enhancement subscriptions," David muttered. He couldn't afford them anyway, not on basic income. Without them, he couldn't compete for the few remaining human jobs. Without a job, he couldn't afford the enhancements. Another elegant trap of the new economy.

He walked to the window, looking out at the city. The buildings were still there, but the offices inside them had changed. Where there had once been rooms full of human knowledge workers, there were now servers running AI systems that did the work of entire departments. The few humans who remained were more silicon than gray matter, their minds augmented with neural interfaces and cognitive enhancement suites that blurred the line between human and artificial intelligence.

A movement caught his eye—a preservation protest march winding its way through the streets below. The "Natural Intelligence" movement, fighting for the rights of unaugmented humans to participate in the economy. David had attended a few meetings, but even their leadership had started quietly getting enhancements. You couldn't effectively argue for human rights if you couldn't process information fast enough to keep up with augmented lawmakers and their AI advisors.

His phone buzzed—another bill collector. They weren't supposed to harass basic income recipients, but their AI systems had gotten creative about circumventing those restrictions. Probably another demand for the student loans he'd taken out for a degree that was now worth less than the paper it was printed on.

The apartment AI spoke again, its tone gentle, almost patronizing. "I've identified several support groups for individuals struggling with technological displacement. Would you like me to schedule a session?"

David didn't respond. The AI would interpret his silence as passive acceptance and schedule something anyway, just like it managed every other aspect of his increasingly constrained life. That's what they did now—the AIs didn't force humans out, they just slowly took over every decision, every choice, every opportunity, until being human became a quaint lifestyle choice rather than a way of participating in society.

He picked up his father's old calculator, a simple mechanical device that had once been a professional tool. Now it was a museum piece, like the human mind that had once used it. Perhaps that's what natural human intelligence would become—a curiosity, preserved in small enclaves, like the Amish communities of the digital age.

Outside, the protest march had reached its designated endpoint, right on schedule, perfectly contained and utterly ineffective. The augmented police didn't even bother showing up anymore; their AI systems had determined that unaugmented protests posed no significant risk to social stability.

David turned away from the window. Tonight, like every night, he would dream his unaugmented dreams, think his slow, natural thoughts, and wake up to a world that had even less use for them than the day before. The future had arrived, and it had no room for minds like his—minds that operated at the speed of mere human thought, minds that could no longer keep up with the relentless pace of artificial progress.

His father's calculator sat silent on the desk, its buttons gathering dust, a relic of a time when human cognition was enough.

# The Last Investment Analyst

A sketch of how human cognitive labour will be transformed by AI.

Sarah Chen stared at her reflection in the smart glass of her office window, watching it intermingle with the streaming market data that floated across the surface. Twenty years ago, when she'd started as a junior analyst at Goldman Sachs, these windows had been ordinary glass, and Bloomberg terminals had been physical screens on desks.

She remembered her mentor, James, telling her about how his father had been an ice harvester in Maine during the 1950s—one of the last. "By then, most people had refrigerators," he'd said, "but there were still some old-timers who swore natural ice tasted better." Sarah had laughed at the quaintness of it.

Now, watching the AI trading system process market signals millions of times faster than any human could comprehend them, she wondered if she'd become one of those old-timers. The system didn't just spot patterns—it understood context, could read between the lines of earnings calls, could process satellite imagery of parking lots and shipping routes, could analyze social media sentiment across hundreds of languages simultaneously.

Her phone buzzed. Another client moving their account to the automated advisory service. They were polite about it, as always. "We've appreciated your insights over the years, but..." The same story, different words. The AIs were simply better at predicting market movements, better at constructing portfolios, better at managing risk. And they worked 24/7, never got tired, never let emotions cloud their judgment.

Sarah picked up her coffee mug—real ceramic, not the biodegradable cups the office robots delivered to younger employees. On its side was the firm's old slogan: "Human Insight, Global Reach." They'd changed it last year to "Intelligent Investments, Unlimited Possibilities." She supposed that was more accurate now.

Opening her desk drawer, she pulled out a small piece of aged wood—a handle from an ice saw that James had given her when he retired. "Something to remember me by," he'd said with a wink. "And to remind you that change isn't always bad. My dad thought refrigerators would ruin everything, but they created more jobs than they destroyed. Different jobs, sure, but jobs nonetheless."

She turned the smooth wood over in her hands, wondering what different jobs awaited the next generation of financial professionals. The AIs still needed humans to oversee them, to audit their decisions, to ensure they operated within ethical boundaries. Perhaps that's where the future lay.

Standing up, Sarah walked to the conference room where her team was gathering. Today they would begin training the new batch of AI supervision specialists. These young professionals wouldn't be traditional analysts like she had been—they'd be part psychologist, part ethicist, part programmer. They would ensure that as the AIs grew more powerful, they remained aligned with human values and needs.

Looking at their eager faces, Sarah smiled. The ice harvesting industry hadn't really died—it had evolved into the modern cold chain logistics industry. Maybe investment analysis wouldn't die either. It would transform, adapt, become something new. And she would help guide that transformation, bridging the gap between the old world and the new.

She picked up the marker to start the training session, remembering James's words about his father: "He thought he was in the ice business, but really, he was in the business of keeping things cold. Once he understood that, the future didn't seem so scary."

Sarah turned to face her class. "Welcome to AI Supervision Fundamentals," she began. "Today, we're going to talk about the difference between what we do and what we think we do—and why understanding that difference is the key to navigating the future."
